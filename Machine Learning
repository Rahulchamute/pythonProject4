Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically 
through experience and by the use of data.[1] It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. 
Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order 
to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
